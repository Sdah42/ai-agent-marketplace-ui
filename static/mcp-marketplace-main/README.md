## 3. Development

#### 3.1 Web Integration

Go to your app main project file, for example in the ./app/ai_search folder, find the main page index.html.

```

<head>

  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"></script>
  <script src="../../plugin/mcp_marketplace/scripts.js"></script>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../../plugin/mcp_marketplace/styles.css">
<head>

<body>


    <!-- add agent marketplace plugin -->
    <div class="agent-plugin">
        <button class="agent-button agent-button-base agent-button-close" data-testid="composer-button-agent" aria-pressed="false" aria-label="agent">
            <div class="[display:var(--force-hide-label)] ps-1 pe-1 whitespace-nowrap">Agent</div>
        </button>
        <div class="panel hidden">
            <div class="panel_section">
                <h3>MCP Tools</h3>
                <div class="grid-container" id="items-grid"></div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

</body>

```


#### 3.2 Get User Selected Tools

In javascript, access the global variables `selectedItems` to get user selected tools and configs

```
    ## ../../plugin/mcp_marketplace/scripts.js
    ## global variable of js module
    window.agent_selected_items = selectedItems;

    ## get access
    var your_variable = window.agent_selected_items

```

#### 3.2 Pagination 

The params for pagination rest API can be user defined for different endpoint. Since different API provider have differnt keys of parameters, will leave a 
mapper function to allow customized and mapping.


| key | type |description  |
| --- | ---- | ---- | 
| query | required | Used to filter the meta by query, serve as the section name also. | 
| count_per_page | required | e.g. 20 | 
| page_id | required | Used as the page selector (page 0 - n) at the bottom of each section, Starting from 0 | 
| offset | optional | The index of items to skip, which is equivalent to (page_id * count_per_page). |
